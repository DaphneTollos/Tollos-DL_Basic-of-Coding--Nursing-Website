		<p> As nurses, education doesnâ€™t end after passing the NCLEX. Nurses are required by law to have the basic skills needed to save a life, whether they work in a hospice setting or an intensive care unit. They may encounter various emergency cases such as sudden cardiac arrest within the units they work in and in settings outside the hospital. In these emergency scenarios, nurses have to be the first to practice basic life support. </p>
		<p> Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can help save a life during a cardiac or breathing emergency. However, even after training, remembering the CPR steps and administering them correctly can be a challenge. </p>
